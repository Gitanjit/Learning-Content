After comparing all the the bifeature graphs , on the basis of observation I have concluded that Feature 1 vs Feature 2 graph depicts 
the labels in the best possible way as the two labels are nearly divided into 2 regions of concentric circles(1st quadrant only) centered
at origin with radii 4 and 8 respectively
